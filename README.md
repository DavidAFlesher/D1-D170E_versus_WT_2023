# D1-D170E_versus_WT_2023
Supplemental repository for data and scripts used in the manuscript "Structure of a mutated photosystem II reveals perturbation of the oxygen-evolving complex"

- The coordinates for the rescaled wild-type and rescaled D1-D170E structures are available in the directory "structural_coordinates" under filenames "rescaled_WT.pdb" and "rescaled_D170E.pdb", respectively. The maps for these coordinate files are available at the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/emdb/) under accession code EMD-41460 and are located under "Additional data".
- The version of the coordinates where water molecules have been renamed, as described in the supporting information, is available in the directory "structural_coordinates" under filename "D1_D170E_2023.pdb". The associated map is the standard map made available either through the Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org/) under PDB code 8TOW or, where both the sharpened and unsharpened maps can be accessed, at the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/emdb/) under accession code EMD-41460.
- Coordinate files for the QM/MM calculations are available in the directory "QMMM_models".
- Helpful ChimeraX scripts are available in the directory "ChimeraX_scripts".
